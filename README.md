This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## add storybook
One of the great modern tools available to us if you aren't already familiar with it is called [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

Storybook gives us an environment to show off and test the React components we are building outside of the application we are using them in. It's great tool to connect developers with designers and be able to verify components we have developed look and function as per design requirements in an isolated environment without the overhead of the rest of the app.

Note that Storybook is meant as a visual testing tool, we will be implementing other tools later for functional unit testing and end-to-end testing.

The best way to learn how to use Storybook is installing it and trying it out!

```
npx sb init --builder webpack5
```

We'll be using the webpack5 version to stay up to date with the latest version of webpack (I'm unsure why it is still not yet the default. Maybe it will be by the time you are using this tutorial).

When Storybook installs it automatically detects a lot of things about your project, like how it is a React app, and other tools you are using. It should take care fo all that configuration itself.

If you get a prompt about the eslintPlugin, you can say "yes". We are going to configure it manually though, so no worries if you get a message saying it didn't auto-configure.

Open up `.eslintrc.json` and update it to the following:

`.eslintrc.json`

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:storybook/recommended", // New
    "next",
    "next/core-web-vitals",
    "eslint:recommended"
  ],
  "globals": {
    "React": "readonly"
  },
  // New
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["*.stories.@(ts|tsx|js|jsx|mjs|cjs)"],
      "rules": {
        // example of overriding a rule
        "storybook/hierarchy-separator": "error"
      }
    }
  ],
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": [1, { "args": "after-used", "argsIgnorePattern": "^_" }]
  }
}
```
